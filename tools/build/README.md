# DuESF Build tools

This folder contains all which is needed to build the framework and its doc.

Just run the `build.bat` script on *Windows* to build DuESF and the doc. The build will be in an `output` subfolder.

Note: you'll need an executable binary of [DuBuilder](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF_DuBuilder), and its containing folder in the PATH variable of *Windows*.
